This project was created as a portfolio page for my first General Assembly Project.

To create this project I used HTML, CSS + javaScript.

The goal of this project is to create a portfolio website that will showcase projects, my recent web design projects and include a link to my resume.

I have added a short bio, a few recent projects and a resume.
